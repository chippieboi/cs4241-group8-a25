## Project Description
We're going to make an RPG animal racing website. Users will log in and create animals with RPG-like stats and race them against other users' animals to compete on the leaderboard!
After logging in, users will see a table that displays their animals and the info that comes with them (RPG stats, name, animal type, wins, etc.). Users can have up to 3 animals.
Below, there will be a form for the user to race their animal. The server will take random animals from other users and create a track for them to race on. The track
will not have visual elements, just stats that favor specific traits that the user can add to their animal. The race will happen, and the server will send a table for the client to display
with the data of what happened during the race and who won. The user can continue to do races as much as they'd like. The user will see what type of race it is and will select the animal from
their collection that best suits the track. Somewhere else on the website will be a leaderboard that showcases the animals with the most wins, who made them, their name, and the type of animal.
There will be a history tab to show the history of all of the races a user's animal has participated in.

There will be a login page that will either sign in the user or create an account for them if the username does not exist. The main page will handle all data showing (animals, races, history, leaderboard).
